### WAGMI
The wagmi command line interface manages ABIs (from Etherscan/block explorers, Foundry/Hardhat projects, etc.), generates code (React Hooks, VanillaJS actions, etc.), and much more. It makes working with Ethereum easier by automating manual work (e.g. no more copying and pasting ABIs from Etherscan). You can also write plugins to extend the CLI further.

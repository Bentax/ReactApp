### WAGMI
The wagmi command line interface manages ABIs (from Etherscan/block explorers, Foundry/Hardhat projects, etc.), generates code (React Hooks, VanillaJS actions, etc.), and much more. It makes working with Ethereum easier by automating manual work (e.g. no more copying and pasting ABIs from Etherscan). You can also write plugins to extend the CLI further.</br>
Installation
Install the @wagmi/cli package to your project as a dev dependency.

```bash
npm i --save-dev @wagmi/cli
```
Create config file
Run the init command to generate a configuration file: either wagmi.config.ts if TypeScript is detected, otherwise wagmi.config.js. You can also create the configuration file manually. See Configuration for more info.
```bash
npx wagmi init
```
The generated configuration file will look something like this:


Устанавливаем библиотеки
```bash
npm install @web3modal/ethereum @web3modal/react wagmi ethers@^5
```
